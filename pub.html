            <h1>idMotif: An Interactive Motif Identification in Protein Sequences, IEEE CGA, 2023, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10368279">Link</a></h1>
            <p>This article presents a visual analytics framework, idMotif, to support domain experts in identifying motifs in protein sequences. A motif is a short sequence
            of amino acids usually associated with distinct functions of a protein, and identifying
            similar motifs in protein sequences helps to predict certain types of disease or infection. idMotif can be used to explore, analyze, and visualize such motifs in protein
            sequences. We introduce a deep-learning-based method for grouping sequences
            and allow users to discover motif candidates of protein groups based on local explanations of the decision of a deep-learning model. idMotif provides several interactive
            linked views for between and within protein cluster/group and sequence analysis.
            Through a case study and expertsâ€™ feedback, we demonstrate how the framework
            helps domain experts analyze protein sequences and motif identification.</p>

            <p>A VA framework, for unraveling peptide and protein interactions. In the framework, users can understand holistic trends, discover patterns, and get insights from the peptide/protein intensity data. Our framework provides multiple linked views to navigate intricate tissue/cancer-related dynamics. We enable researchers to shift effortlessly from an overview of the input data to granular statistical insights.</p>
